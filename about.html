      <p>My name is Noah Steele. I grew up in south eastern Michigan, in a small town called Manchester. This will be my 4th year at Michigan State, and I am so glad to be back on campus. Some of my favorite hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Watching Movies</li>
            <li>Going to MSU Sporting Events</li>
            <li>Traveling</li>
            <li>Going to breweries</li>
            <li>Spending time with friends, family, and my dog</li>
        </ul>

      <p>My major is Information Science, and I am also minoring in Computer Science. During the summer of 2021, I worked as an IT Tech Assistant for Manchester Community Schools, which is actually the school that I graduated from. During my time there I got to see a little bit of what some jobs in my field might look like.</p> 
      <p>During my time at MSU, I have worked in the Equipment Room at Jennison Fieldhouse and the Breslin Center as a student equipment manager for several teams at MSU. Some of my duties include laundering uniforms and gear, checking in new items into our inventory system, and handling everyday issues that student athletes might have regarding their equipment. It has been a great experience for me to be able to get to see another side of college athletics that you don't see as a spectator.</p>
      <p>Overall, I have enjoyed my time at Michigan State, and can't wait to see how the rest of this course, and the rest of my career at MSU pan out!</p>
