        <p>The 41st Season of the hit CBS reality show Survivor is back on air after over a year long hiatus. Production was ceased due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, show runners and executive producers have been brainstorming new ideas that will revitalize the show that once captured an audience of over 50 million people.</p>
        <p>However, fans of the show have grown wary of the promise of a "new era" and a "new game." Much of what fans love about the show come fromt the unique bonds that people develop after enduring such extreme conditions. Many fans would prefer to see the show take a step back from the new twists and advantages in the game, and would rather see the show focus on character relations and the strategy taking place between contestants.</p>
        <p>Even though Survivor fans like to complain, there is no quesiton that the vast majority of the fans will remain loyal to the show they've loved for years. No matter what Jeff and company throws at us as viewers, we will continue to tune in week after week.</p>

        <p>The 2021 Formula One season is shaping up to be one of the most memorable in recent years. The battle for top driver for this year's World Driver's Championship has been tighter than ever. Max Verstappen (Red Bull) is the current points leader after last Sunday's Turkish Grand Prix. Followed closely behind is Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes), who has won 7 World Championships. Verstappen is looking to become the youngest world champion driver in Formula One history by claiming his first world title.</p>
        <p>As for the Constructor's Championship, Mercedes holds a decent lead over Red Bull. With a victory at the Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday for Mercedes, at the hands of Valterri Bottas, Mercedes looks to maintain their lead in hopes of continuing their long streak of dominance in F1. Mercedes has won the last 7 Constructor's World Champions and doesn't plan on stopping that trend anytime soon. Given the recent rule changes that have limited Mercedes (and other wealthy teams) ability to outspend every other team, it isn't unreasonable to believe that we will start seeing other teams vie for the top spot in Formula One.</p>
        <p> The next race on the Formula One calendar takes place on Sunday, October 24th, 2021 in Austin, Texas at the Circuit of the Americas. </p>
